# Cloudflare Craft Plugin

Automatically purge Cloudflare URLs when specific Assets and Entries are edited. Optionally clear the whole thing from the Craft control panel as well.

## Installation and Setup

Drop the `cloudflare` folder in your `craft/plugins` directory, then visit Settings â†’ Plugins and install the Cloudflare plugin.

Add your Cloudflare API key, email and zone details to the plugin settings. Be sure to test, because testing is always a fabulous idea.

## Troubleshooting

If a given cache doesn't seem to be cleared, make sure `devMode` is enabled and check /craft/storage/runtime/logs/cloudflare.log. You should find brief traces that identify cache-clearing attempts and summarize responses from the Cloudflare API. Please be prepared to share these logs if you're looking for help.

Submit an issue here or email hello@workingconcept.com if you run into any issues, and I'll make my best effort to respond in a timely fashion. I appreciate any feedback at all, and appreciate your patience since this is a free-time project.

## Limitations

- Doesn't know or care what Cloudflare is caching, just tries clearing URLs in update+delete conditions.
- Some features are rough: purging individual URLs (from plugin settings), and setting up cache-breaking rules (if you can figure out how).
- May not be suitable for sizeable bulk operations; if you replace or delete a massive number of files, it could result in the same number of hits to the Cloudflare API.

## Miscellanea

The plugin's icon uses the Cloudflare logo mark [found on this page](https://www.cloudflare.com/logo/) and is the property of Cloudflare.
